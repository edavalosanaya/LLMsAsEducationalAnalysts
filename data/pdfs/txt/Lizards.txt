“Lizards” – Reading

Lizards extend or flick their tongues to help them "sense" their
environment. The information gathered tells them the whereabouts
of food and mates, and warns them of the presence of enemies. But
their tongues have other uses, too.
A tree-dwelling chameleon is the "marksman" of the reptile world.
Its tongue, kept rolled up in its mouth, is as long as or longer than
its body. When the chameleon spots an insect, it shoots its sticky
tongue out, and zap!—instant lunch.
The Australian blue-tongued skink sticks out and waves its fat blue
tongue to frighten away its enemies.
Geckos use their long tongues to clean their faces—including their
eyes.
