## Lizards

“Lizards” – Reading

Lizards extend or flick their tongues to help them "sense" their
environment. The information gathered tells them the whereabouts
of food and mates, and warns them of the presence of enemies. But
their tongues have other uses, too.
A tree-dwelling chameleon is the "marksman" of the reptile world.
Its tongue, kept rolled up in its mouth, is as long as or longer than
its body. When the chameleon spots an insect, it shoots its sticky
tongue out, and zap!—instant lunch.
The Australian blue-tongued skink sticks out and waves its fat blue
tongue to frighten away its enemies.
Geckos use their long tongues to clean their faces—including their
eyes.

## Tastes

“Tastes” – Reading

Although humans can recognize the tastes of many different foods,
human taste buds can perceive only four primary tastes. Each of
these distinct tastes is perceived by a different part of the tongue.
The sweet taste is detected by the tip of the tongue. That is why
humans tend to lick an ice cream cone or a lollipop. The bitter taste
is sensed toward the rear of the tongue. That may be why humans
do not notice a bitter taste as quickly as one notices a sweet taste.
Salty and sour tastes are experienced along the sides of the tongue.
A substance can only be tasted if it is capable of dissolving in water.
Then it can dissolve in the saliva present in your mouth, too.

## Lodgepoles

“Lodgepole” – Reading

In a forest destroyed by a great fire, scientists found lodgepole pine seeds.
This passage tells why.
The seeds of lodgepoles form inside cones. There are two kinds of
cones. One kind simply opens and frees its seeds. The seeds are
winged and they whirl away from the parent plant. That is how
lodgepoles usually reproduce. The second kind of cone is sealed
tight by a thick coat of resin and is hard as a rock. These cones open
only in high heat—at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit. In the blackened
forests scientists found 50,000 to 1,000,000 lodgepole seeds to an
acre. All had come from sealed cones that were opened by the heat
of fire. Most would become food for small animals, but some would
sprout.
