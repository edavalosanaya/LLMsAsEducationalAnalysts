“Ants” – Reading

Some ants act like partners with plants. The best-known
partnership is with some kinds of acacia trees.
These "ant" acacias have hollow thorns in which the ants live. The
ants patrol the trees, ready to attack whatever creatures land there.
Ants protect acacias from other plants, too. They chew up vines that
try to climb the acacia trees. And they may even keep all other
plants trimmed back for several feet around.
In return for their protection, the ants get food as well as a place to
live. They eat special pods that grow on the acacia's leaves. They
also drink nectar produced in special glands at the base of the
leaves.
