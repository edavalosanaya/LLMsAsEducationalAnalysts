“Lodgepole” – Reading

In a forest destroyed by a great fire, scientists found lodgepole pine seeds.
This passage tells why.
The seeds of lodgepoles form inside cones. There are two kinds of
cones. One kind simply opens and frees its seeds. The seeds are
winged and they whirl away from the parent plant. That is how
lodgepoles usually reproduce. The second kind of cone is sealed
tight by a thick coat of resin and is hard as a rock. These cones open
only in high heat—at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit. In the blackened
forests scientists found 50,000 to 1,000,000 lodgepole seeds to an
acre. All had come from sealed cones that were opened by the heat
of fire. Most would become food for small animals, but some would
sprout.
