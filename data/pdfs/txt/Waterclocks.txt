“Water Clocks” – Reading

The early Greeks and Romans used water to tell the time. A large
bowl with a small hole in the bottom was filled with water. As the
water trickled through, the falling water level uncovered markings
inside the bowl. These told how time was passing. This was an
important innovation that helped them to the see the length of time
that different things were taking.
The Chinese and Indians used water clocks that worked the other
way around. A small brass bowl with a tiny hole was floated on top
of the water. As the bowl filled up, the water covered markings on
its side. When the bowl sank, a gong was struck and the bowl was
emptied and floated again. This shows another way that early
people modeled time.
