“Clouds” – Reading

Most of the water in clouds comes from the ocean. Then why
doesn't it rain over the ocean and nowhere else?
Before the water droplets in a cloud can get big enough and heavy
enough to rain, the air where the cloud is must get cool enough for
a lot of drops to come together. The ocean holds heat very well. The
warm ocean does not get cold enough at night to cool the air over it.
The land cools much more quickly.
Clouds do not condense over the ocean unless cold air from land
blows over the warm water. What usually happens is that the wind
blows water vapor from the ocean over the land, where it is cooled
into clouds.
