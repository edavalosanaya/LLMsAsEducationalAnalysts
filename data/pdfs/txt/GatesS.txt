## Ants

“Ants” – Reading

Some ants act like partners with plants. The best-known
partnership is with some kinds of acacia trees.
These "ant" acacias have hollow thorns in which the ants live. The
ants patrol the trees, ready to attack whatever creatures land there.
Ants protect acacias from other plants, too. They chew up vines that
try to climb the acacia trees. And they may even keep all other
plants trimmed back for several feet around.
In return for their protection, the ants get food as well as a place to
live. They eat special pods that grow on the acacia's leaves. They
also drink nectar produced in special glands at the base of the
leaves.

## Clouds

“Clouds” – Reading

Most of the water in clouds comes from the ocean. Then why
doesn't it rain over the ocean and nowhere else?
Before the water droplets in a cloud can get big enough and heavy
enough to rain, the air where the cloud is must get cool enough for
a lot of drops to come together. The ocean holds heat very well. The
warm ocean does not get cold enough at night to cool the air over it.
The land cools much more quickly.
Clouds do not condense over the ocean unless cold air from land
blows over the warm water. What usually happens is that the wind
blows water vapor from the ocean over the land, where it is cooled
into clouds.

## Waterclocks

“Water Clocks” – Reading

The early Greeks and Romans used water to tell the time. A large
bowl with a small hole in the bottom was filled with water. As the
water trickled through, the falling water level uncovered markings
inside the bowl. These told how time was passing. This was an
important innovation that helped them to the see the length of time
that different things were taking.
The Chinese and Indians used water clocks that worked the other
way around. A small brass bowl with a tiny hole was floated on top
of the water. As the bowl filled up, the water covered markings on
its side. When the bowl sank, a gong was struck and the bowl was
emptied and floated again. This shows another way that early
people modeled time.
