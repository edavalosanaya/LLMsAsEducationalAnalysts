“Tastes” – Reading

Although humans can recognize the tastes of many different foods,
human taste buds can perceive only four primary tastes. Each of
these distinct tastes is perceived by a different part of the tongue.
The sweet taste is detected by the tip of the tongue. That is why
humans tend to lick an ice cream cone or a lollipop. The bitter taste
is sensed toward the rear of the tongue. That may be why humans
do not notice a bitter taste as quickly as one notices a sweet taste.
Salty and sour tastes are experienced along the sides of the tongue.
A substance can only be tasted if it is capable of dissolving in water.
Then it can dissolve in the saliva present in your mouth, too.
