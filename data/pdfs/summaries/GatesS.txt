## Ants
Some ants form a mutualistic relationship with acacia trees by living in their hollow thorns, protecting them from predators and competing plants, while receiving food and shelter in return.

## Clouds
Clouds form primarily from ocean water, but rain usually falls over land because the land cools faster than the ocean, causing water vapor to condense into clouds and produce precipitation.

## Waterclocks
Ancient Greeks, Romans, Chinese, and Indians used water clocks in different ways to measure time, either by tracking falling water levels or by using floating bowls that sank when filled.
