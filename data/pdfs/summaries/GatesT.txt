## Lizards
Lizards use their tongues for various purposes, including sensing their environment, capturing prey, scaring off enemies, and even grooming themselves.

## Tastes
Humans can perceive only four primary tastes—sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—each detected by different parts of the tongue, and only substances that dissolve in water can be tasted.

## Lodgepoles
Lodgepole pines have two types of cones, one of which remains sealed with resin until exposed to high heat, allowing their seeds to be released and regenerate forests after a fire.
