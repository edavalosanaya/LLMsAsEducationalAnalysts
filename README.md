## Overview

This repository accompanies the research paper **"LLMs as Educational Analysts: Transforming Multimodal Data Traces into Actionable Reading Assessment Reports."** The study explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize multimodal reading assessment data—such as **eye-tracking metrics, learning outcomes, and teaching standards**—into **teacher-friendly reports** to aid classroom instruction.

The project combines **unsupervised clustering** with **LLM-driven report generation**, enabling data-driven insights that assist educators in identifying students' reading behaviors and challenges.

## Features

- **Multimodal Learning Analytics**: Uses **eye-tracking, reading performance metrics, and assessment standards** to analyze student reading behaviors.
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: Identifies distinct **reading behavior profiles** using **K-Means** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**.
- **LLM-Generated Reports**: Converts raw analytics into structured, interpretable insights for educators.
- **Teacher Evaluation Pipeline**: Includes teacher feedback and LLM-based assessments to refine reports.

## Research Findings

- **Clustering Effectiveness**: K-Means produced the best reading behavior segmentation, with 4 distinct student profiles.
- **LLM-Generated Reports**: Teachers found clustering insights and content analysis highly useful, but recommended improved readability.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Combining LLM + teacher evaluations refined the clarity and pedagogical relevance of the reports.
